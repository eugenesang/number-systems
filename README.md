# Number Systems
>>Human language for some reason has its number system as decimal.
>>>That is its base ten numbers
>>computers on the other hand have binary number system base two

My attempt is to create a program where a user defines their own number system and insert their digits to use.
The next thing is to convert a normal human number to their own defined.
For demo i used 0-9, A-Z, and a-z making up 62 digits and tried to convert numbers to this sytem and back.
I have also tried to impliment this stuff in different languages
>> * C++
>> * Javascript
>> * Python

I also wish to see more languages with these.
 ## Codding is fun
