# Number Systems
>Human language for some reason has its number system as decimal.
>>That is its base ten numbers

>computers on the other hand have binary number system 
>>That is base two

My attempt is to create a program where a user specifies their own digits to  be used to represent numbers.

The next thing is to convert a normal human number and represent it using the digits they specified.

For demo I used 0-9, A-Z, and a-z making up 62 digits and tried to convert numbers to this sytem and back.


I wish to see more languages with these.

More expirienced people also correct me
