# Functional Aproach to Mathemathical Operations
**The class based aproach to arithmethic operation might be overwhelming sometime**
I tried to do the have the functional aproach to the same problem.
The problem i have currently:
 * safely representing numbers in their signed notation
 * safely representing floating point numbers and perfoming arithmethics on them
 * finding the fastest ways to do operations like multiplication, division and square-roots
